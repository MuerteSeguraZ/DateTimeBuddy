# Changelog

All notable changes to **DateTimeBuddy** will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.4] - 2025-07-27

### Added
- `fromNow()` — Returns a string like `in 5 minutes` or `30 seconds ago` based on current time and instance.
- `timeAgo()` — Returns a human-readable string like `2 hours ago`, `just now`, etc.
- Friendly formatting examples in multiple locales (e.g. French, Japanese).
- Support for formatting localized strings via `toLocaleString()`-backed helpers (used in tests).
- Enhanced `daysBetween` logic to support timezone-aware comparisons.
- Sample test script output now includes:
  - Timezone switching demo
  - Start/end of day in local timezones
  - Locale-specific friendly strings

### Changed
- Improved time difference math for more accurate second granularity in `fromNow()` and `timeAgo()`.
- Test output shows UTC and localized behavior side by side for better debugging.

### Fixed
- Cloning preserves timezone properly.
- `equals` comparison now distinguishes between date-only vs full date-time.
